# Human Dura Atlas

### Welcome to the Human Dura Atlas

This is the corresponding website to the publication Colocalization of fibrosis and inflammation in the dura in progressive multiple sclerosis by Börsch & Schafflick et al.

We present a large scale single cell transcriptional and spatial atlas of human dura in health and disease (multiple sclerosis). Interactive visualizations of the single-nuclei dataset and the spatial transcriptomics data (Xenium) can be found below.
